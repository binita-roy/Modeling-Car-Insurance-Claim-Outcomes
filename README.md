# üöó Modeling Car Insurance Claim Outcomes

## üèÅ Project Goal
The primary objective of this project is to identify the best predictors of whether a customer will make a car insurance claim using logistic regression. By analyzing client demographic, vehicle, and behavioral data, we aim to:
- Predict claim outcomes with high accuracy.
- Understand the relative importance of various features in influencing claim likelihood.

## üîç Dataset Description
The dataset includes information about car insurance clients and contains the following key features:
- **Demographics**: Age, Gender, Marital Status, Education, Income Level.
- **Vehicle Information**: Ownership status, Year of Registration, Type of Vehicle.
- **Behavioral Data**: Driving experience, Annual mileage, Past accidents, Speeding violations, DUIs.
- **Target Variable**: `outcome` (0 = No claim, 1 = Made a claim).

The dataset has been preprocessed to ensure it is suitable for modeling, with all missing values handled appropriately.

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Identified and handled missing values using imputation techniques.
   - Retained categorical features as integers (no additional encoding).

2. **Modeling**:
   - Logistic regression was chosen for its interpretability and effectiveness in binary classification problems.
   - Splitted the dataset into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets.
   - Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

3. **Feature Importance Analysis**:
   - Examined the coefficients of the logistic regression model to understand the importance of different predictors.

## üìà Visualizations
1. **Distribution of Claims**:  
   - This bar chart shows the distribution of claim outcomes across all clients. It helps in understanding the overall proportion of clients making claims versus those who don't.
2. **Credit Score Distribution by Outcome**:  
   - This histogram shows the credit score distribution for both claim outcomes (No Claim and Made a Claim). It reveals any patterns or differences in credit scores between the two groups.
3. **Annual Mileage by Income Group and Claim Outcome**:  
   - This boxplot visualizes the relationship between income groups, annual mileage, and claim outcomes. It highlights trends and variations in mileage across different income levels and claim statuses.
4. **Feature Importance Chart**:
  - A bar plot showcasing the relative importance of features.
5. **Confusion Matrix**:
  - Visualization of true vs. predicted values to highlight model accuracy.

---

## üß† Conclusion
- The model achieved a strong **accuracy of 84.77%**, demonstrating reliable performance in predicting claim outcomes.
- **Driving experience** and **vehicle ownership** emerged as the most influential predictors of insurance claims.
- Opportunities for improvement include testing other machine learning models (e.g., decision trees or ensemble methods) and incorporating additional features for better prediction accuracy.

## üõ†Ô∏è Future Work
- Exploring other classification algorithms such as Random Forests or Gradient Boosting to compare performance.
- Performing hyperparameter tuning to optimize the logistic regression model.
- Developing a dashboard to visualize insights interactively.
